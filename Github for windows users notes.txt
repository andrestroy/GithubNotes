#Basic steps to use github on the browser

#1 Create repository
#2 submit a new issue
#3 create a branch (branch early, branch often, like checkin early, check in often)
#4 perform a change into the branch
#5 commit the change into the new branch (do not forget to add a title con the commit)
#6 create a pull request
--> there are tree magic words that goes into the pull request comment: fixes, resolves and closes next to the <#number of the issue>
--> once the branch is merged, the issue is automatically fixed, closed or resolved.
#7 merge new branch to the master branch.
